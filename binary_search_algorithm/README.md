## Binary Search Algorithm Program
This program will find if a number, from user input, is included in the list and then print it. The list has been generated using numpy. There's no need to sort the list before doing a Binary Search since it's already sorted.

Things to learn:
     Binary search algorithm
     Linear search algorithm
     NumPy Library
