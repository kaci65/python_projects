## Fibonacci Sequence
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
```
Formula =>  Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
The beginning of the sequence is therefore: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 ...
